<p>Hello welcome to our introduction CTF. This CTF is to give you an idea
of how does ethical hacking works within a CTF environment. If you don’t
know what a CTF, a CTF is basically a exercise/game in which “flag” are
hidden within purposefully-vulnerable programs or websites. A CTF flag
would look something “CTF{g3t_g00d_n00b2}” and would be hidden within
a root/admin folder. There are multiple types of CTFs such as: Forensic
CTFs (which utilities digital forensics), Web CTFs where the attacker
attacks a web server (which is what we will be covering today), Reverse
Engineering (which involve exploiting a program binary), etc.</p>
<p>The platform that this CTF will be hosted is TryHackMe but they are many
other websites such as HacktheBox, PicoCTF, etc.</p>
<h2 id="applications-preinstalled-such-as--kali-linux-debian-testing-base">Prerequisites: * This guide assumes you have already installed and
setup a Linux distro. * This also assumes your familiar with your
Distribution’s package manager and can use it from the command line. *
OpenVPN * Gobuster * A Linux Distribution running in a VM, WSL, Docker
container or Live USB preferably a Pen Testing focused one (Since they
contain a wide selection of pen testing and digital forensic
applications preinstalled) such as: * Kali Linux (Debian Testing base)</h2>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="https://www.kali.org/get-kali">https://www.kali.org/get-kali</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->.
* Parrot Security (Debian Testing base) -

* BlackArch (Arch Linux base) -
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="https://blackarch.org/">https://blackarch.org/</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
* If you’re not familiar with Linux, the best to learn it is to try and
play within a VM and use it has a normal desktop system (Start with
beginner friendly distro such as Linux Mint, Ubuntu LTS, Solus and Pop
OS LTS) for least 30 minutes a day (That’s how I learned it :) ) or
watch this playlist by Network Chuck:

<h1 id="step-1---connect-to-tryhackme-via-openvpn">Step 1 - Connect to TryHackMe via OpenVPN</h1>
<p>Download and install OpenVPN from your distro repos (If it’s not
installed). “Sudo apt install openvpn”. Then login to TryHackMe, create
an account if you don’t already have.</p>
<p><img src="./OpenVPN.png" alt="TryHackMe Profile drop-down box"> Click on your profile
and select in the drop down box “Access”.</p>
<p><img src="./Step.png" alt="Figure 2"> Then click “Download my Configuration File” once
you have selected the closest VPN Server.</p>
<p><img src="./Terminal.png" alt="Figure 3"> Finally open a terminal but clicking it on
desktop menu or by using the keyboard shortcut “Ctrl+Alt+Del” cd into
your Downloads directory then type in &ldquo;sudo openvpn <em>Your THM
Username</em>.ovpn to load the OpenVPN configuration file (Please keep the
terminal window that OpenVPN is running open).</p>
<p><img src="./Status.png" alt="Figure 4"> Then check the access to verify that your is
connected to the THM Network. Now you’re ready for hacks :D.</p>
<h1 id="step-2---deploy-your-vm">Step 2 - Deploy your VM</h1>
<p><img src="./Start_Machine.png" alt="Figure 5"></p>
<p>Click on Start Machine to begin and wait 1 minute for the IP address to
display.</p>
<p><img src="./FakeBank.png" alt="Figure 6"> Once the IP address has been displayed,
paste the IP address into your browser search box and the “fakebank”
webpage should appear.</p>
<h1 id="step-3---its-gobusting-time">Step 3 - It’s Gobusting Time</h1>
<p>We will be using the program “Gobuster” to brute-force the webpage for
possible server directories using a word list. Check for dirbuster
word-lists in the folder “/usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists”. If it’s not
on your system, search for a wordlists package in your distro repos. If
it’s not in your distro repos. Download the wordlists from this github
page:
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="https://github.com/pradeepch99/dirbuster_wordlist">https://github.com/pradeepch99/dirbuster_wordlist</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Use the command “gobuster -u <em>THM IP Address</em> -w <em>your_wordlist</em> dir”
this command performs a brute-force directory attack on the fakebank
website.</p>
<p><img src="./dir.png" alt="Figure 7"> The directories that are found within the
wordlist are accessible pages on the website.</p>
<h1 id="step-4---breaking-the-bank">Step 4 - Breaking the bank</h1>
<p><img src="./Admin_Tool.png" alt="Figure 8"> The -transfer page should appear within
the scan. This secret bank transfer webpage allows the attacker to steal
money from any bank account registered with fakebank. This is a highly
critical risk to the bank. Since we are ethical hackers in training
(well I hope so &gt;:( ) we would find the vulnerabilities within the web
application and report to the bank before the hacker exploits them.
Transfer $2000 USD from 2276 into 8881 by using the fake bank staff
account.</p>
<p><img src="./Flag_1.png" alt="Figure 9"> We should go back to check if “Mrs G.
Benjamin” has successfully received $2000 from fake bank and a flag to
input into TryHackMe.</p>
